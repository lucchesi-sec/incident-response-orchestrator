Comprehensive incident response automation platform for threat detection, analysis, and automated response capabilities.

## Overview

The Incident Response Automation Suite provides automated security incident detection, analysis, and response capabilities. It integrates with existing security tools and follows industry-standard incident response frameworks (NIST, SANS).

## Features

### 🔍 **Threat Detection**
- Real-time log analysis and correlation
- Anomaly detection using behavioral baselines
- Integration with SIEM platforms (ELK Stack, Splunk)
- Custom detection rules and signatures

### 🚨 **Incident Analysis**
- Automated threat classification and severity scoring
- Evidence collection and preservation
- Timeline reconstruction and attack path analysis
- Threat intelligence enrichment

### ⚡ **Automated Response**
- Configurable response playbooks
- Automated containment actions
- Network isolation and quarantine
- Evidence preservation and forensic imaging

### 📊 **Reporting & Compliance**
- Automated incident reports
- Compliance framework mapping (SOC2, PCI DSS, NIST)
- Executive dashboards and metrics
- Forensic evidence chain of custody

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start incident response monitor
python -m incident_response monitor --config config.yaml

# Run threat detection
python -m incident_response detect --source syslog

# Execute response playbook
python -m incident_response respond --incident INC-2024-001 --playbook malware_containment
```

## Detection Capabilities

### Network Security
- Suspicious network traffic patterns
- DDoS attack detection
- Lateral movement detection
- DNS tunneling and exfiltration

### Host Security  
- Malware execution detection
- Privilege escalation attempts
- Unauthorized file access
- Process anomaly detection

### Application Security
- SQL injection attempts
- Authentication bypass attempts
- Session hijacking detection
- API abuse patterns

### Cloud Security
- Unusual AWS API activity
- Unauthorized resource creation
- Data exfiltration patterns
- Identity and access violations

## Integration Support

- **SIEM Platforms**: ELK Stack, Splunk, QRadar
- **Network Security**: pfSense, Cisco ASA, Palo Alto
- **Endpoint Security**: CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, Defender
- **Threat Intelligence**: VirusTotal, AlienVault OTX, MISP
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS, Azure, GCP
- **Communication**: Slack, Teams, PagerDuty, Email

## Compliance & Standards

- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Complete mapping to framework functions
- **SANS Incident Response**: Six-step process implementation
- **SOC2 Type II**: Automated controls and evidence collection
- **PCI DSS**: Payment card incident response requirements
- **ISO 27035**: International incident management standard

## Security Considerations

- **Encrypted Communications**: All integrations use encrypted channels
- **Access Controls**: Role-based access with multi-factor authentication
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail of all actions
- **Evidence Integrity**: Cryptographic hashing and chain of custody
- **Secure Storage**: Encrypted storage for sensitive incident data

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Redis server
- MongoDB (optional for extended storage)
- PostgreSQL (optional for advanced analytics)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lucchesi-sec/incident-response-orchestrator.git
   cd incident-response-orchestrator
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure environment:**
   ```bash
   cp config/config.example.yaml config/config.yaml
   # Edit config.yaml with your settings
   ```

4. **Initialize database:**
   ```bash
   python -m incident_response init-db
   ```

5. **Start services:**
   ```bash
   # Start orchestrator
   python -m incident_response orchestrator
   
   # Start web interface (optional)
   python -m incident_response web
   ```

## Configuration

The system uses YAML configuration files in the `config/` directory:

- `config.yaml` - Main configuration
- `detectors.yaml` - Detection rules and sources
- `playbooks.yaml` - Response playbook definitions
- `integrations.yaml` - External system configurations

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=incident_response

# Run specific test category
pytest tests/test_detection.py
```
